# Daily Build - April 2, 2024

## Description
This daily build is focused on building out an interview question that I experienced. The question was to build out a class based on the interface in interviewQuest.txt. I tried this in python live during the interview and failed pretty tremendously - so I will start building out in a daily repo to try some different interview questions and approaches.
